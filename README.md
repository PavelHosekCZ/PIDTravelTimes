# PIDTravelTimes

A script that calculates travel time using Prague public transport from a selected stop to all other stops. Output can then be visualised using google maps. This tool can help compare different places of interest, which can be useful for example when choosing a school, job, sport facility or a doctor.

To use the script, one must obtain their own google key (associated to their google account). For simplicity, this key must be hardcoded into main.py.
